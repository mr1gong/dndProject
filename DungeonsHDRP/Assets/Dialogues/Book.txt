  <NpcLine>INTRODUCTION TO THE DIVERSION OF THE LITTLE ONES</NpcLine>

      <NpcLine>It was a proverb established after those of an antique
usage that whoso seeketh what he should not
findeth what he would not ; and clear thing it is that
the ape, for drawing on boots, was trapped by the foot.
This also befell a beggarly handmaid, who, never having
worn shoes to her feet, must needs wear a crown on her
head ; but, as all wrongs meet their requital, and anon
comes one that compensates for each and every, at last,
having by wicked ways usurped what belonged to others,
she was caught at the wheel, even as says the by-word,
'The higher the height, the lower the lapse ' : and this
shall be shown after the fashion that follows.
It is said that once upon a time there was a king of
the Bushy Valley that had a daughter named Zoza, and
she, like another Zoroaster or Anacretus,* was never seen
to smile. The afflicted father, having none other life and
spirit than this his only daughter, left nothing undone to
lighten her melancholy. The better to provoke from her
a laugh, he summoned now drolls who walk upon</NpcLine>

          <NpcLine>maceheads, and then fellows who jump through circles, and
anon boxers, and rivals of Master Roger the juggler, and
workers of legerdemain, and anon fellows strong as
Hercules, and now the dancing dog and the leaping old
man, and then the ass that drinks from a tumbler and
the bitch Lucia Conazza * : briefly, now one thing, and
then another. But 'twas all lost time, for neither the
remedy of Master Grillo,t nor the herb sardonion, nor a
dig in the diaphragm would make her smile in the
least.
At length the unfortunate father, wishing to make a last
attempt and not knowing what else to do, gaye orders
to build a great fountain of oil fronting the palace gate,
with design by so doing that the folk who crowded like
ants passing to and fro that way should be obliged, so
as not to soil their clothes, to skip like crickets, and
buck-jump like goats, and scurry like hares, pushing and
knocking one against another : thus hoping that somewhat might occur which would make his daughter laugh.
So this fountain being built, as Zoza was standing at her
lattice window, looking sour as vinegar, she saw an ancient
woman coming to the fountain, and soaking up the oil
with a sponge, filling therewith an earthen ewer she had
brought with her ; and whilst so doing, a certain court
page threw a stone so true to an hair that he hit the ewer
and broke it to bits. Hereat the old woman, who was
by no means hairy of tongue, nor held herself from
speaking her mind, turned to the page, and thus began to
say: 'Ah, kindchen, scatter-brains, piss-a-bed, goat-dancer,
petticoat-catcher, hangman's rope, mongrel mule, spindleshanks, whereat if ever the fleas cough, go where a palsy</NpcLine>

Never mayest thou see the first of May! May a Catalan
lance thrust thee through! Mayest thou be touched with
the rope and never lose a drop of blood ! A thousand
miseries reach thee, with the rest to boot; and, in short,
may the wind blow away thy sail, so that the seed
may be lost, thou knave, pimp, son of a whore ! '
The lad, who had little beard and less discretion, hearing
this flow of abuse, repaid her with the same coin, saying,
'Wilt thou not hold thy tongue, devil's grandam, bull'svomit, children-smotherer, turd-clout, farting crone ? '
The old woman, hearing all the news of her household
thus cried aloud, waxed so wroth that, losing all patience,
she raised the curtain of her clothes, and showed a truly
rural scene, whereof Silvio* might have said, ' Go, wake
the eyes with the horn.' When this spectacle was beheld
by Zoza, she fell backwards, laughing so much that she
had well-nigh fainted. Hereupon the old woman became
even more furious, and turning a fierce look upon Zoza,
cried, 'Go! and mayest thou never see the bed of an husband, unless thou take the Prince of Campo Rotundo ! '
Zoza, who heard these words, summoned the crone and
perforce would learn if she had meant to lay a curse upo!i
her, or only to abuse her ; and the other answered, ' Now
thou must know that the prince I have named is a
wonderful creature, Thaddeus hight, who, having been
cursed by a fairy, came to the last picture of life, and was
laid in a tomb outside the city walls, and upon his
tombstone an inscription is graven : 'Whosoever of
womankind will in three days fill with tears an earthen
vessel which hangs upon an hook, she will bring him to
life and strength, and will take him to husband.' But</NpcLine>

                  <NpcLine>as it is impossible for two human eyes to run so much
with weeping as to fill an earthen vessel which holds
half a flagon, save, as I have heard recounted, it were a
certain Jinniyah who became at Rome a fountain of
tears, I, because I saw myself derided, have given you
this curse, which I pray Heaven may fall upon you in
revenge for the injury done me.' And thus saying, the
old woman ran down the steps and went her way, being
afeard that something might happen to her.
Meanwhile the princess pondered over the words of the
old woman, and meditated, and doubted, and feared, and
at length drew from them that passion which blindeth our
judgment and darkeneth the mind ; and she determined
to fly from her father's house, and taking with her many
thousand crowns and jewels, left the palace, and fared
along until she reached the castle of a fairy, to whom
she told her story. The fairy, taking compassion of such
a beautiful young maiden, and desiring to help her on
account of her youth and her great love to an unknown
being, gave her a letter of recommendation to her own
sister, who was also a fairy ; and taking kindly leave of
her, presented her with a walnut, saying, 'Take this, 0
my daughter, and keep it by thee, but open it not save
in time of great stress.' The princess took the gift and
the letter, and proceeding on her journey, ceased not
wayfaring until she arrived at the castle of the second
fairy, who also received her graciously, and well entreated
her. And on the next morning, before taking leave, the
fairy gave her a letter for another sister of hers, and
presented to her a chesnut, with the same advice which
had been given to her before. She fared on until she
reached the castle of the third fairy, who also welcomed
her, and entreated her kindly. The following morning,</NpcLine>

                      <NpcLine>before her departure, the fairy presented her with an
hazel-nut and the same injunctions as the other sisters.
Having received these things, Zoza fared on through
cities and villages, wilds and wolds, passing seas and rivers,
until after seven years she arrived, tired and worn by so
much wayfaring, at Campo Rotundo, where, before entering
the city, she perceived a mausoleum of marble at the
foot of a fountain where a porphyry criminal wept tears
of crystal : and hung thereon was the earthenware flagon.
Taking the vessel down, and putting it before her, she
shed two rivulets of tears ri\·alling the fountain, never
lifting her head from its mouth, so that at the end of
two days the tears had filled it to the neck, and there
remained only two inches more. But, wearied by so much
stress and trouble, she was taken by a deep sleep, so that
she lay perforce under a tent close by for well-nigh two
hours. In the meantime a certain slave, Cricket-legs
hight, who came often to that fountain to fill an hogshead,
and who knew well the matter. of the inscription, which
was spoken of everywhere, hid herself when she beheld
Zoza weeping, awaiting that the earthen flagon should be
nearly full, hoping by some wile to win the remainder to
herself, and thus leave the princess with a handful of flies.
And as she beheld her asleep, she thought the time had
come for her advantage, and dexterously taking the earthen
juglet, and putting her eye upon its mouth, filled it to the
brim in a short time. Hardly was it full when the prince,
awaking as from heavy sleep, arose from the marble sarcophagus, and threw his arms around that mass of black flesh
and leading her to his palace, with feasts, and joyance, and
revelry took her to wife. But no sooner did Zoza awake to find the grave open, and the juglet gone, and with
lt all her hopes and joys, than she came ncar to unpacking</NpcLine>

last, seeing that for this evil there was no remedy, and
that she could blame nought but her own eyes which
had watched so ill that which held her desire, she arose,
and fared on, and entered the city.And when she heard
of the bridal feasts of the prince and of the fine wife he
had taken to himself, she imagined how the misfortune
had come to pass, and said to herself, sighing, ' Alas!
two black things have crushed me to the earth : black
sleep and a black slave.' Then, desiring to struggle
against death, from which e\·ery kind of animal trieth to
defend itself, Zoza took a fine house fronting the
prince's palace, from within which she could not behold
the idol of her heart, but could at least look upon the
walls of the temple which held him for whom she longed
with excessive longing.
Herewhile Zoza was seen one day of the days by
Thaddeus, who had been flying until then like a moth
around that black, hideous slave.When he beheld her,
he became as an eagle, and held e\·er present in mind
the beauty and comeliness of Zoza, even as it is one
of the privileges

The slave failed not to perceive of
place in the prince's mind, and she
was wroth with exceeding wrath, and being with child
by Thaddeus, threatened him, saying thus: ' If thou
wilt not close the window, I will punish my belly and
murder little George.' The prince, who loved his race,
trembled like a leaf, and liked not to anger his wife, anJ
therefore shut himself in, although it seemed to him he
had taken the life out of his body in depriving himself
of the sight of Zoza's beauty. The princess, perceiving
herself deprived of the only means of beholding Thaddeus, </NpcLine>

                              <NpcLine>and having lost every hope, not knowing what to do in
this her time of need, bethought herself of the three gifts
of the fairies, and cracking the walnut, out flew a handsome bird, the handsomest that had ever been seen in
the world. The bird began to sing, and trill, and quaver
at the window as no other bird had done before, and
having been seen and heard by the slave, she could not
rest without it, and so, calling the prince, said to him,
' If thou wilt not get for me that bird that sings so well,
I will punish my belly and murder little George.'
Thaddeus, who had let himself be ridden by her, sent at
once to the princess to ask if she would sell it. Zoza
made answer that she was not a seller of birds, but if he
would accept it as a gift, she would present it to him.
The prince, desiring to please his wife on account of the
child she would bring to light, accepted the offer ; but
about four days after, Zoza opened the chesnut, and out
of it stalked a fowl with twelve chicks of gold, which
were seen by the slave upon the same window-sill, '·ho
at once longed to have them, and sending for the prince,
pointed to them, saying, ' If thou bring me not that fowl
and chicks, I will punish my belly and murder little
George' ; and Thaddeus, who allowed this bitch to
pull him by the nose, sent again to the princess, offering her whatever she chose for such a priceless fowl, and
he received the same answer as before : that he might have
it as a gift, but to ask of buying it would be but lost
time. And as he could not, and dared not, refuse,
necessity had the best of his discretion ; and he vias
humbled by the generosity of a woman, their liberality
being very scarce, as they are never spoiled, not even by
owning all the ores of India.But having passed other
four days, Zoza opened the hazel-nut, from which came</NpcLine>

                                  <NpcLine>forth a doll, who was spinning gold, a most marvellous
thing. No sooner was she put at the same window than
the slave saw her, and sending for the prince, said to him,
' If thou bring me not that doll, I will punish my belly
and murder little George' ; and Thaddeus, who let his
wife send him about as yarn-blades, by whom he was
ridden at her pleasure and crushed by her pride, not
having courage to send for the third time to the king's
daughter for the doll, thought it best to go himself, remembering the old saws, 'There is no better messenger
than thyself,' and ' Who wanteth goeth, and who wanteth
not sendeth,' and 'who will cat fish must take it by
the tail,' and beseeching her to forgive his boldness for
begging these things because of the whims of a woman
great with child, asked for the doll. Zoza, who was nigh
a-fainting because of the cause of all her travail, hardened
her heart, and allowed him to pray and beseech of her
the gift of the doll, so as to have her lord ncar her and
hear his voice, and to enjoy the light of his presence a
little longer-he who had been stolen from her by an
hideous slave. At last she gave him the doll, as she had
done all the other things ; but before she handed it
to him, she begged the doll to make the slave long to
hear tales and stories. Thaddeus, who beheld the doll
in his hand without spending a single crovm, felt crushed
by so much kindness, and he offered Zoza his kingdom
and his life in exchange for so much pleasure ; then
returning to his palace, he gave the doll to his wife.
No sooner did she place it in her bosom to play with
it than it appeared as Cupid in the form of Ascanius before
Dido, and lit a fire in her heart, and great desire to hear
stories and tales, so that at last, fearing to lose her life on
account of her great longing, and to give birth to a manchild</NpcLine>

her husband, and said to him, ' If thou wilt not call folk
to tell me stories, I will punish my belly and murder little
George.' Thaddeus, desiring to get rid of this March
nuisance, gave orders to the crier to publish that all the
women of the city should come to the palace on such
a day, and on the appointed day, at the shooting forth
of the star Diana, which forerunneth the dawn to prepare
the way by which the sun must pass, they should meet
all at the same place. But the prince, unaccustomed to
see such a crowd, and having no particular taste for the
whims of his wife now that she longed to sec so many
folk around her, chose only ten of the noblest in the city,
who seemed to him the more prm·oking and full of talk.
And there were limping Zcza, crooked Cecca, When - necked
Meneca, long - nosed Tolla, hunchbacked Popa, flabbering
Antonella, musty Ciulla, checkless Paola, hairless Ciommetella, and rough - hewn Giacova ; and, having written their
  names on a paper, he discharged the others.
Then they arose With the slave from under the daYs, and
all fared slowly to the palace garden, where the trees and
boughs were so Well interlaced one with another that the
sun's rays could not penetrate underneath their leafy screen,
and they seated themselves under a pavilion covered \dth
a creeping vine, amiddlemost of which played a fountain.
Grand Master of the School of Courtiers Prince Thaddeus
thus began to say: 'There is nothing more pleasing and
glorious in the world, 0 my noble women, than to hearken
to the deeds of others; and not without reason did
Aristoteles, that great philosopher, place man's greatest
happiness in listening to pretty stories, since in hearkening
to them care and gloom vanish, and life is lengthened.

those clever story - tellers, whose tales can rival the best
gazette ever written.By which reason I must excuse my
wife, who, having become of a melancholic mood, desireth
so much to listen to some pleasant tale: and therefore,
if ye are willing to fulfil her wants and to catch mid - air
also my desire, ye will be pleased in these four or five
days that ye will remain to empty your stomachs and
recount every day a story, such as those old women
tell for the entertainment of the children, meeting
always in this same site, where, after having eaten, ye
will begin by recounting, and Will end the day by reciting
an eclogue, and thus we will spend joyously our life, and
all the worse for him who dieth.' Hearing these words,
all bmvcd their heads downwards in humble assent to
Thaddeus's command.
In the meanwhile the tables were spread, and food was
laid upon them, and they all began to eat ; and having
ended, the prince made a sign to Zeza the limping that
she should open the fire.</NpcLine>
